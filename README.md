# Data Science Projects Repository

This repository contains four data science projects that cover various aspects of data analysis and machine learning. Below, you'll find a brief description of each project along with the key objectives and steps involved.

## Project-1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

**Objective**: Design a sentiment analysis model for tweets on Twitter.

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess tweet text data.
2. Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical features.
3. Model Selection: Choose a classification algorithm and train it on the labeled dataset.
4. Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project-2: Ratings of Guvi Courses

**Objective**: Create a regression model to predict course ratings on Guvi.

**Steps**:
1. Data Exploration: Understand the dataset and its characteristics.
2. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features and preprocess the data.
3. Model Selection: Choose a regression algorithm and train it on the dataset.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

## Project-3: Instagram Influencers

**Objective**: Analyze data on Instagram influencers and answer questions.

**Steps**:
1. Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset's structure and features.
2. Correlation Analysis: Identify correlated features and calculate correlation coefficients.
3. Frequency Distribution: Create histograms and bar charts for key features.
4. Country Analysis: Determine the country with the most Instagram influencers and create a bar chart for counts.
5. Top 10 Influencers: Rank influencers based on various criteria.
6. Relationship Analysis: Visualize relationships between specific pairs of features.

## Project-4: Image Classification (Cats vs. Dogs)

**Objective**: Build a binary classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

**Steps**:
1. Data Acquisition: Download the dataset of cat and dog images from Kaggle.
2. Data Preprocessing: Resize, split, and augment the dataset as needed.
3. Feature Extraction: Extract features from images using CNN-based methods.
4. Model Design: Create a binary classification model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network).
5. Model Training: Train the model using the training data.
6. Evaluation: Assess the classifier's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC analysis.
